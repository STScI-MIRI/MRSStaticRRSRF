MIRI MRS point source residual fringe correction
================================================

Goal is to derive static 1D residual fringe correction vectors
for point sources observed with the standard 4 point dither pattern.
Use calibration observations for flux standards and asteroids to 
derive the average residual fringes for each channel and grating.
